# KMeans-Clustering-Demonstration-SKLearn

This KMeans clustering belongs to Prototype-based clustering by calculating the centroids at random.

The dataset I created consists of 150 randomly generated points that are roughly grouped into three regions with higher density.
Then I have created a KMeans model with k=3 and visualized the output.
